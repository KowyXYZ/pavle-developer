        <p className='text-gray-500 w-[300px] sm:w-full tracking-widest'>I'm a 19 year old developer living in Serbia. I discovered my passion for coding
after seeing it on youtube and some teachers doing it in school.
I developed a passion for channeling my creativity into crafting web apps &
projects. I didnt go to university and pursue a coding career, facing challenges
along the way. With persistence, self-discipline, and unwavering commitment, I
successfully attained the status of a full-stack developer. The driving force
behind my journey has been the thrill of continually learning and embracing
novel challenges.</p>
